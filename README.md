# BlueJobs
The objective of this project is to develop a job portal for the  blue collar employees like drivers, cooks,mechanics,etc . 
By using this portal employees can easily apply for blue collar jobs and recruiters can find suitable candidates for their jobs. 
Blue-collar Job Portal is a web based application portal for assisting the blue-collar workers in finding jobs seamlessly and enabling 
the employers to post jobs efficiently. 
A project that seeks to provide employment to the poorest of the destitute citizens of our nation who cannot use Linkedin to look for their jobs.
The application provides the ability for customers/employers to create their accounts, search candidates, create postings for blue collar jobs, and 
view job seekerâ€™s applications.
